## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: Access the website with the same state as when it was closed, as everything is stored on the server side via a REST API (using a JSON server, see below)
- **Bonus**: See the past time up to the time the comment or reply was created. For this purpose unix timestamps are created, stored and retrieved.
